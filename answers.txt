What happens if users choose “Cancel”? 
-> You've chosen no

How to customize the options to users, e.g. only two options: “Yes” and “No”, OR “I do”
and “I don’t” (Suggestion: Use Javadocs or using Eclipse/Netbean IDE help). 
-> Use showOptionDialog instead of showConfirmDialog and create a option array

#Lab02
